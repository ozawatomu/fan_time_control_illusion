# Fan Time Control Illusion

By flashing light at the same frequency as an oscillating object, we can make it appear as if it is frozen in time. This is because our eyes only perceive the object in motion when it is lit up by the light and if we only see it when it returns to the same point in time, then effectively, our minds see it as a frozen object. If we alter the frequency slighty, we get a new effect where the object may appear to be moving slowly or even moving in reverse direction. This Arduino project does exactly this. It is simply a potentiometer controlling the frequency of three LEDs (three so that it is brighter). Although it is a similar effect to other videos which relies on the refresh-rate of the camera, this effect looks the same, if not better, in real life.
